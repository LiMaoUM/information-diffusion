The total includes $53 million raised online in the 24 hours after the former president was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money trial. Trump Campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said: We are moved by the outpouring of support for President Donald J. Trump. The American people saw right through Crooked Joe Biden’s rigged trial, and sent Biden and Democrats a powerful message – the REAL verdict will come on November 5th, President Trump raised $141 million this month because Americans remember the roaring economy, secure border, and peace through strength at home and abroad under Donald J. Trump, and we will return to prosperity and success when he is re-elected in November.\",\n",
