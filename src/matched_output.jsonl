On top of that, the Times poll shows a significant gap by education among minority voters. Non-college minority voters are significantly less likely to support Biden than college-educated minorities, with non-college minorities supporting Biden by just nine percentage points, 47 percent to 38 percent, while college-educated minorities support Biden by over 30 points, 61 percent to 27 percent.", "Happy Birthday to the true leader of the free world, our beloved President Donald J.
