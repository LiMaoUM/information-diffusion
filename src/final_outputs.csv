Comparisons between the ex-president and the 20th-century Nazi leader are controversial but a new book says they resemble each other as political performance artists Henk de Berg, a professor of German at the University of Sheffield in Britain, whose previous books include ""Freud‚Äôs Theory and Its Use in Literary and Cultural Studies"", has just published ""Trump and Hitler: A Comparative Study in Lying"" In it, De Berg compares and contrasts Hitler and Trump as political performance artists and how they connect with their respective audiences. He examines the two men‚Äôs work ethic, management style and narcissism, as well as quirks such as Hitler‚Äôs toothbrush moustache and Trump‚Äôs implausible blond hair. ‚ÄúWe tend to see Hitler as a genocidal mass murderer, which of course he was, but not so much as a populist. I thought looking at it through the perspective of Trump can help us wrap our heads around the idea as to why so many people actually supported Hitler and vice versa.‚Äù Above all, De Berg argues, Hitler and Trump were and are political performance artists who speak only vaguely about policies ‚Äì Make Germany/America great again ‚Äì but know how to draw attention using jokes, insults and extreme language. In this they differ from Joseph Stalin, the Soviet autocrat who was a poor public speaker and preferred to work behind the scenes. ‚ÄúTheir extremist statements are very deliberately meant to provoke a reaction and to get them into the press. Hitler actually writes quite openly about this in Mein Kampf and this of course is the challenge: what do you then do as a journalist or as an opposing political party when the other person makes these extreme statements? Along with its headline-grabbing potential, the extremist language also plays well with many voters. De Berg says: ‚ÄúMost of their electorate are dissatisfied with the status quo for a variety of reasons ‚Äì globalisation, automation ‚Äì so they want to change the system and here you have an anti-establishment candidate who is not politically correct, who says that we will sort it, who doesn‚Äôt come up with all these ‚Äòcowardly, rotten compromises‚Äô.‚Äù Many such voters are ready to blame a scapegoat, ‚Äúthe other‚Äù. Hitler blamed Jews for Germany‚Äôs defeat in the first world war; Trump launched his 2015 campaign demonising immigrants from Mexico and continues to put border security front and centre. ‚ÄúIt decomplexifies the world.

**Explanation:**

*   **Narrative Frame:** The repeated ""Interesting"" suggests a sense of intrigue or perhaps veiled suspicion. Without context, it's difficult to pin down a more specific frame, but it leans towards questioning something. It *could* be used sarcastically, or it could be a genuine expression of curiosity about something, but it lacks specifics to identify a more defined frame like ""corruption"" or ""media bias.""
*   **Main Subject:** The post doesn't mention any specific person or entity, so the main subject is unclear.
*   **Stance toward main subject:**  As there is no subject, there is no stance.

  ""Stance toward main subject"": ""Ambivalent/Skeptical"",

**Explanation of Classification Choices:**

*   **Narrative Frame:** The repeated use of ""fascinating/interesting"" without specific context strongly suggests a commentary on *how* information is being presented or perceived, rather than the content itself. This points toward a narrative frame of media bias or a belief that something is being intentionally obscured or manipulated. The lack of specifics prevents a more precise frame.
*   **Main Subject:** The post doesn't explicitly name a person. The vagueness implies it might be a criticism directed at the broader political establishment or, most likely, the media's handling of a situation. Thus","```json
